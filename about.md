<h2>A little bit about us</h2>
<p>
    SECRETSALES has one very simple goal – <strong>to save you money every time you shop</strong>. Unlike traditional retailers SECRETSALES launches new sales every single day of the week from hundreds of well-known brands, all at <strong>30-70% off</strong>. This means that not only is there something new to shop every time you visit, but <strong>you’ll never pay full price for anything</strong>.
</p>

<h3>How it all works?</h3>
<p>
    As a flash sales website we launch new sales every day from hundreds of brands you know and trust. Every sale lasts for <strong>4</strong> days and has discounts of between <strong>30- 70% off</strong>, giving you what you want for less.
</p>
<h3>Top tips for shopping at SECRETSALES</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our sales run for a limited time only so you need to be quick to get the best deals. <strong>Visit SECRETSALES every day</strong> to ensure you don’t miss out and open our <strong>daily sales emails</strong> to see what’s new.</li>
    <li>In order to bring you such amazing discounts we only place an order with our brands once a sale has ended. This means it will typically take up to <strong>two weeks</strong> for your order to arrive. But with our products at such tempting prices, we think <strong>it’s worth the wait</strong>.</li>
    <li>Look out for the <strong>speedy 3-5 day delivery</strong> symbol on specific sales if you want your goodies sooner.</li>
